# README

This is a prototype for an ecommerce site, NKRawson Creations. It was created with Ruby on Rails as part of my Full Stack Web Development course from Udemy.

Through this, I learned about basic website structure, form validation, automatic mailers, splash pages, the Model-View-Controller architecture, login/logout setups, how to handle payments, etc.
